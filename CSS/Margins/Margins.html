		<h1>Margin Demo</h1>
		<p id="p1">The anarchist organisation known as Street Action Group (SAG) first came
		to light in summer 2003 when its leader Chris Bradford hijacked the
		rostrum at an anti-Iraq-war demonstration in London’s Hyde Park.
		light to straw-filled effigies of Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President
		George W. Bush. By 2006 SAG had built a cult following and was strong enough 
		to begin staging its own anti-government protests. These culminated in July
		 with the Summer Mayhem March through central Birmingham. Dozens of cars were
		vandalised, windows were broken, more than thirty protestors were arrested
		and a police officer was stabbed.In the months that followed, prison sentences
		were handed down to several senior SAG members involved in the rioting. Heavy 
		police presence wherever SAG planned to appear made staging violent protests 
		increasingly difficult.Chris Bradford became bitter at what he called 
		‘state oppression’ and an MI5 agent sent to infiltrate SAG made a shocking 
		discovery: Bradford was trying to acquire guns and bomb-making equipment in 
		order to transform SAG into a terrorist organisation.

		<p id="p2">Frank and Joe, both star athletes at Bayport High, were the sons of Fenton Hardy, a former New York City
		police detective who. had retired from the force and was now a world-famous private investigator. His two
		boys already showed signs of following in their father’s footsteps. Their most recent mystery, The Firebird
		Rocket, had taken the young sleuths to Australia on the trail of a missing space scientist.Joe glanced through the letters the postman had handed him and plucked out one addressed to The Hardy Boys. He went inside and tossed the others on the hall table, then hurried to join his brother, who was already easing their car down the drive. Soon they were bowling along towards the Quinn Air Fleet terminal, just north of town, where the airship would dock.</p>

		<p id="p3">CHERUB is a branch of British Intelligence. Its agents are aged between
		ten and seventeen years. Cherubs are all orphans who have been taken
		out of care homes and trained to work undercover. They live on
		CHERUB campus, a secret facility hidden in the English countryside.About three hundred children live on CHERUB campus. JAMES
		ADAMS is our twelve-year-old hero. He’s basically a good kid, but he
		has a habit of getting himself into trouble. There’s also his younger
		sister, LAUREN. KERRY CHANG is a Hong Kong born Karate
		champion. GABRIELLE O’BRIEN is Kerry’s best friend. BRUCE
		NORRIS, another Karate champion, likes to think of himself as a hardman but still sleeps with a blue teddy under his chin. KYle BLUEMAN is a more experienced CHERUB agent. He’s two years older than James, but still a good mate .Cherubs are ranked according to the colour of the T-shirts they wear on campus. ORANGE is for visitors. RED is for kids who live at CHERUB
		campus, but are too young to qualify as agents. BLUE is for kidsundergoing CHERUB’s tough 100-day basic training regime. A GREY
		T-shirt means you’re qualified for missions. NAVY is a reward for
		outstanding performance on a mission. If you do well, you’ll end your
		CHERUB career wearing a BLACK T-shirt, the ultimate recognition for
		outstanding achievement. When you retire, you get the WHITE T-shirt,
		which is also worn by staff.</p>

		<p id="p4">During World War Two, French civilians set up a resistance movement to
		fight against the German forces occupying their country. Many of their
		most useful operatives were children and teenagers. Some worked as
		Scouts and messengers. Others befriended homesick German soldiers,
		gathering information that enabled the resistance to sabotage German
		military operations.
		A British spy named Charles Henderson worked among these French
		children for nearly three years. After returning to Britain, he used what
		he’d learned in France to train twenty British boys for work on
		undercover operations. The codename for his unit was CHERUB.
		Henderson died in 1946, but the organisation he created has thrived.
		CHERUB now has more than two hundred and fifty agents, all aged
		seventeen or under. Although there have been many technical advances
		in intelligence operations since CHERUB was founded, the reason for its
		existence remains the same: adults never suspect that children are spying
		on them.</p>

		<p id="p5">ames Adams had been looking forward to spending Saturday night in town at the bowling
		alley, but now he was here he’d got himself in a mood. The four other CHERUB agents on the
		lane seemed to be having far more fun than he was.
		Kyle was in great form, lording it over everyone, buying them hotdogs and Cokes with the
		small fortune he’d made burning pirate DVDs for half the kids on campus. Kyle always had
		some dodgy money-making scheme going on, but as far as James could work out this was the
		first one that had ever earned decent money.
		The identical twins, Callum and Connor, were also enjoying themselves, despite their stupid
		bet with each other that one of them could get off with Gabrielle before the night was out.
		James had told the twins they were dreaming: they might be nice guys, but Gabrielle was
		thirteen and totally fit. If Gabrielle wanted a boyfriend – which as far as anyone could tell she
		didn’t – she could do better than pick between two gangly twelve-year-olds with dishevelled
		blond hair and a gap the size of a Mars bar between their crooked front teeth.
		‘Strike …’ Gabrielle shouted, as ten pins rattled off in different directions. She flailed her
		arms and jiggled her bum about, doing a kind of freaky war dance. ‘You’re up, Kyle,’ she
		whooped. Gabrielle turned away from the scene of her triumph to see Callum and Connor grinning at
		her from their plastic chairs, either side of where she’d been sitting before she bowled.
		‘Great shot,’ Callum beamed. ‘Didn’t I say you’d bowl better if you swung your arm back a little less?’ Connor interrupted,
		as he shot an evil glance at his identical twin. ‘Your balance is much better now.’
		Gabrielle remembered the advice, but she hadn’t bowled any differently to normal. The
		strike had been down to luck. She looked at her plastic seat and realised she couldn’t handle
		another second of the two boys fawning over her. She reached under her chair and grabbed
		her bag. ‘Where are you going?’ Callum asked apprehensively. ‘What’s the matter?’
		‘James looks a bit down in the dumps,’ Gabrielle explained. ‘I’m gonna sit with him for a
		minute and see if I can cheer him up.’ ‘Good idea,’ Connor grinned. ‘I’ll come with you.’
		‘No,’ Gabrielle said stiffly. ‘You two are gonna stay right there.’
		‘But…’ Connor said, half standing up before sitting down again.
		‘Look,’ Gabrielle said. ‘I don’t mean to be rude, but you two are acting seriously weird and
		it’s getting on my nerves. Can’t you let me have five minutes’ peace?’
		Gabrielle felt bad as she reached over and pulled her jacket off the back of her chair. Both
		twins had the exact same expression: like toddlers whose mother had punished them by
		confiscating their favourite toy</p>

		<p id="p6">While Shak stepped behind Stein’s desk and dropped the Venetian blind, James
		surveyed the office. It contained nothing exciting: basic desk and chairs, two
		filing cabinets and a coat rack. Shak used the lock gun to undo the metal
		cabinets, then began sifting through the files. He was looking for any papers
		relating to George Stein’s personal life, especially anything to do with his
		campaigning for environmentalist groups.
		James sat at the desk and switched on Stein’s PC. While the computer booted
		up, he pulled a miniature JVC notebook from his backpack and ran a network
		lead between the two computers. Stein’s machine demanded a password, but
		James wasn’t flustered. He started up a suite of hacking tools on his computer
		and used it to run system diagnostics on Stein’s machine.
		Once the software had gleaned basic information about Stein’s hard drive and
		operating system, James opened another module of the hacking software, which
		allowed him to view all of Stein’s files.
		‘Candy from a baby,’ James smiled confidently.
		Now he could see the files, James clicked the Clone icon and the notebook
		began copying the entire contents of Stein’s PC on to its hard drive.
		‘How much data’s he got?’ Shak asked, as he pulled out the second drawer of
		the cabinet.
		‘Eight-point-two gigabytes. The progress bar says it’ll take six minutes to
		copy it all across.’
