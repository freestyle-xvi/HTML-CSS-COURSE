		<p>This is even more sample text because I still don't know what to type here since I still don't like using Sublime Texts Lorem Ipsum random sample text since it's still just some boring latin. This text is still basically useless since it's just there to be styled by some color atttributes so yeah , cold war sucks still and mw is and forever will be one of the best cod's in years.</p>
